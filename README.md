# R Introductory Course and Team Data Fluency
This repository contains all the content I produced at One Acre Fund to increase capacity of staff to interpret and perform data analysis. Content produced here came from two channels.  The first was a 5 part introductory course in R that I developed and led in conjunction with two other analysts. I have only included the two lessons that I personally developed and led. This course was open to all teams and demand was so high that the internal training department at One Acre Fund picked up the course to make it a standard offering to all employees. The second was a series of three lessons I developed specifically to build capacity to use and data for decision-making for the Operations team.
